* Documentation: https://utl_geom2d.readthedocs.io

* Free software: LGPL v3 license

A simple 2D geometry package that includes point, line, arc, ellipse,
cubic bezier, and miscellaneous utilities.

Originally a part of TCNC this was split out into its own repo
to make it easier to reuse in other projects...


Installing
----------

.. code::

    pip install utl-geom2d

Note:
.....

Requires Python 3.9 or greater.
